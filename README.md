# Go-Guardian
Go-Guardian is a golang library that provides a simple, clean, and idiomatic way to create powerful modern API and web authentication.

## Overview 
Go-Guardian sole purpose is to authenticate requests, which it does through an extensible set of authentication methods known as strategies.<br>
Go-Guardian does not mount routes or assume any particular database schema, which maximizes flexibility and allows decisions to be made by the developer.<br>
The API is simple: you provide go-guardian a request to authenticate, and go-guardian invoke strategies to authenticate end-user request.<br>
Strategies provide callbacks for controlling what occurs when authentication `should` succeeds or fails.

## Installing 
Using go-guardian is easy. First, use go get to install the latest version of the library.

```sh
go get github.com/shaj13/go-guardian
```
Next, include go-guardian in your application:
```go
import "github.com/shaj13/go-guardian"
```

## Why Go-Guardian?
When building a modern application, you don't want to implement authentication module from scratch;<br>
you want to focus on building awesome software. go-guardian is here to help with that.

Here are a few bullet point reasons you might like to try it out:
* provides simple, clean, and idiomatic API. 
* provides top trends and traditional authentication methods.
* provides a package to caches the authentication decisions, based on different mechanisms and algorithms.
* provides two-factor authentication and one-time password as defined in [RFC-4226](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226) and [RFC-6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238)
* provides a mechanism to customize strategies, even enables writing a custom strategy
